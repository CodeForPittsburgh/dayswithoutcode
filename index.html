	<p>Hello! My name is (name). I&rsquo;m a (constituent, concerned citizen, research scientist) and I am concerned by the removal of the Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act Compliance Information from the USDA&rsquo;s website.<br>
		Though these are but two datasets, I fear that more and more publicly available information may be removed at the behest of the new administration.<br>
		To paraphrase Julia Wapner, &quot;The knowledge that the government collected is our knowledge, and as a country, we have a right to it.”<br>
	As James Madison wrote, &quot;Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.”<br>
	I&rsquo;d like to see the aforementioned datasets returned to open public access, and I&rsquo;d like to know what your plan is moving forward to protect and safeguard the federal datasets still available.</p>
